                <h1>Hello! I'm Rachel, nice to meet you!</h1>
                <p>
                    I am currently a junior at Cornell University majoring in Information Science with a focus in UX design and behavior science. I am curious about the intersection and relationship between people and technology and believe it can always be improved by instilling empathy in design.

                    Early last year, after taking an introductory product design class, I felt the experience click and decided to shift gears to create impact through design. Since then, I've been actively learning new tools and methods, working on fun and challenging projects, and meeting new people passionate about creating good user experiences. I'm excited to keep learning from my peers, mentors, and collegues and look forward to working on other exciting projects!

                    In my down time, I'm drawing in my sketchbook or doodling in Photoshop. I love creating characters and making their stories come to life! </p>
